weewx-airlink change history
----------------------------

1.4 05/30/2024
Fix broken install.

1.3 10/07/2022
When computing AQI, round to nearest integer (rather than truncate).

1.2 06/25/2022
Remove EPA correction.  The EPA correction is meant for PurpleAir.  It needs PM2.5 CF1 readings,
but the Airlink only provides PM2.5 ATM readings.  Hence forth, this Airlink extension will
report Airlink readings with no correction.

1.1 08/27/2021
Switch to 2021 version of US EPA Correction
See: https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2021-05/documents/toolsresourceswebinar_purpleairsmoke_210519b.pdf
Provide more guidance on applicability of Purple Air's EPA correction to the AirLink sensor.

1.0.2 03/23/2021
Fix broken labels for aqi and aqi_color observations.  Thanks to ArendPWS for this fix.

1.0.1 12/02/2020
Minor changes in dealing with when a PM2.5 value is not availble.
Installer and extension of 1.0 release incorrectly listed version as 0.2.
Minor code cleanup.

1.0 10/31/2020
--------------
Switch to US EPA correction for PM2.5.  This correction is
always applied.  The US EPA correction is meant for PurpleAir sensors;
however--in a sample size of 1, AirLink tracks well to PurpleAir sensors.

This release removes availability of the uncorrected PM2.5
concentrations.  It also removes the LRAPA and UNBC corrections.

The reason for this change is that the EPA correction needs the
temperature and humidity as reported by the sensor.  These values
are not saved by the extension, so it is not possible to construct
the EPA corrected concentration later.  The extension could find an
unused column in the schema to store the AirLink's temperature and
humidity, but the author has deemed this more trouble than it is
worth.  If the user doesn't like this change, please continue to
use the 0.1 version of this extension.

Please note that the value stored as PM2.5 (i.e., the EPA corrected
value) is much better than the raw value, the LRAPA value and the
UNBC value.  The EPA corrected concentration has been shown to
result in the correct US EPA AQI category 92% of the time and only
one off from the correct category 100% of the time.  This was
true for all regions in the study (throughout the USA) and for
all conditions (including wildfire smoke).
